### Project Title: Analysis of Returns in Fashion E-commerce Websites

#### Project Description

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive market research analysis on the rate of returns for online fashion purchases, specifically focusing on items returned due to unfitting sizes or not meeting customer expectations. The analysis covers multiple popular fashion e-commerce websites, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior and return patterns within the online fashion retail industry.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Data Collection:**
    - Gather data on the total number of orders placed within a specified recent period (e.g., the last six months or last year) from several popular fashion e-commerce websites.
    - Identify the number of orders returned.
    - Determine the number and percentage of returns due to items being unfit or not looking as expected based on the customer's online purchase.

2. **Analysis:**
    - Analyze and summarize findings for each website.
    - Compare return rates across the selected websites.
    - Provide insights into patterns or trends observed, such as variations in return rates based on the type of clothing or demographic factors.

3. **Visualization:**
    - Create detailed visual representations (tables, charts, and graphs) to illustrate the data analysis and make the findings accessible and understandable.

4. **Report Preparation:**
    - Compile a comprehensive report that includes all findings, visualizations, and insights. The report aims to be clear, well-structured, and conclusive.

5. **Submission:**
    - Ensure the report is in the specified format (PPT, PDF) and includes any raw data or supplementary information used in the analysis.

#### Datasets Used:
- **FashionDataset.csv**: Contains order and return data for various fashion e-commerce websites.
- **E-Commerce DataSet.xlsx**: Provides additional order details and return information.
- **Amazon Sale Report.csv**: Specific dataset for Amazon's sales and returns data.

#### Key Features:
- Analysis of return rates for popular e-commerce websites like Myntra, Nykaa, Ajio, ASOS, and Zalando.
- Comparison of total return rates, unfit return rates, and "not as expected" return rates across different websites.
- Visualizations to aid in the interpretation and presentation of the data.
- Comprehensive reporting of findings, patterns, and insights.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and code execution.

#### How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install the required libraries using the command:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell to execute the code and generate the analysis and visualizations.

#### Conclusion:
This project offers valuable insights into the return patterns of online fashion purchases, helping retailers understand consumer behavior and potentially improving their return policies and customer satisfaction strategies. The comprehensive analysis and visualizations provide a clear understanding of the factors influencing return rates in the online fashion retail industry.
